# Dispatcher

Dispatcher is a simple truck driver dispatch management app made using React. It was created for the Rose Rocket summer coding challenge. 

Dispatcher records Dropoff, Pickup and Other tasks on a basic calendar interface and allows for editing and deletion. It allows users to interact with calendars for 3 different drivers over a span of 52 numbered weeks.

<em>Some user stories were not completed</em>. The unfulfilled requirements were:
- when a task is being edited, it does not offer the option to overwrite currently existing tasks if the task times overlap
- no driver spreadsheet report functionality has been added

## Dependencies

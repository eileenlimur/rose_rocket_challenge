# Dispatcher

Dispatcher is a simple truck driver dispatch managing app created for the Rose Rocket summer coding challenge.  It records Dropoff, Pickup and Other tasks on a basic calendar interface and allows for editing and deletion. It was made using Create React App and is my first app made from scratch since I began learning to code 3 months ago.

Some basic user stories were fulfilled but many were not. The unfulfilled requirements were:
-If a new task conflicts with existing task times, the application should give me the option to overwrite the existing conflicting task(s).
  -instead the app overwrites without asking
-predicting and preventing edge cases
-all of Part B

## Available Scripts

run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

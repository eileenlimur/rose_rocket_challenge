# Dispatcher

Dispatcher is a simple truck driver dispatch managing app created for the Rose Rocket summer coding challenge.  It records Dropoff, Pickup and Other tasks on a basic calendar interface and allows for editing and deletion. It was made using Create React App.

Some user stories were not completed. The unfulfilled requirements were:
-when a task is being edited, it does not offer the option to overwrite currently existing tasks if the task times overlap
-no driver spreadsheet report functionality has been added

## Dependencies

-React
-React-DOM
-Classnames


## Available Scripts

run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
